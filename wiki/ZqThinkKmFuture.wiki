The Future of Knowledge Management
 * 作者: Randy Emelo
 * 快译: ZoomQuiet


== 以往 ==
||旧KM实施将很快无法适应当前总在快速变化的环境！特别是在知识资源和管理流程,以及支持系统间的关系理解方面.||Old knowledge management practices no longer fit today’s fast-paced environment. The future lies in understanding knowledge sources, measuring where and how knowledge flows and reinforcing knowledge with supportive relationships.||
||全球化,高科技,组织化,学习者界面... 所有试图提升KM价值的领域,都在使用已经无法满足当前知识工作需求的 人-文档 技术!||Globalization. Technological advancements. Organizational flux. Leaner workforces. All of these factors are impacting knowledge management practices and causing significant changes in the field. The commonplace use of person-to-document techniques is no longer adequate for today’s knowledge workers.||
||当机构保持运行时，签约并迅速地扩大、简单地获取数据和信息已经不再能足以帮助企业蓬勃发展和激发创新。工人们面对日益增长的对改进工艺、产品和服务的需要，同时，由于有许多工人下岗，他们每个人还得做三个人的工作。等待自上而下地灌输知识不是一个选项。||As organizations remain in flux, contracting and expanding rapidly, simply accessing data and information is no longer sufficient to help the enterprise flourish and spark innovation. Workers face the growing need to improve processes, products and services, all while doing the jobs of three people because of layoffs. Waiting for knowledge to trickle down from the top is not an option.||
||今天，知识管理的现实是人们更加需要直接从其源泉来了解它。仅仅一份文件是不够的。人们需要与具体的人进行交流互动，了解是如何改进某服务/增加了销售线索/完成了一项技术实施。他们想看看：什么是对，什么是错，怎样达到成功的，以及他们怎样才能效法这种成功。在应用这些知识时，他们需要得到此前已经体验过、能够鼓励和指导他们的人的支持。全球化和技术使人们更容易感到孤立，因此，人们不再想独自去做它。||The reality of knowledge management today is that people need tacit knowledge and know-how directly from the source. Just reading a document is not enough. People need to interact with the person who has improved his or her service rating, increased sales leads or completed a technology implementation. They want to see firsthand what went right, what went wrong, how success occurred and how they can emulate that success. They need support from the person who has done it before and who can encourage and guide them as they apply the knowledge. Globalization and technology have made it far too easy to feel isolated, and people no longer want to go it alone.||

== 未来 ==
||知识管理的未来与联系相关。人们要有各种关系，他们想相互分享知识，并且，他们想联系他们的同事。三湾协会（Triple Creek Associates）最近的一项调查请1,300名网上良师益友参与者给各种培训学习机会的效力进行评级打分。作为最有效的方法，回答者压倒性地选择了实际动手的人际培训方法。88%将在职培训、80%将良师益友/教练评为非常有效或最有效。而电子教学得分最低，只有37%的回答者将它评为非常有效或最有效。||The future of knowledge management is about connections. People want relationships. They want to share knowledge with one another, and they want to be connected to their colleagues. A recent survey by Triple Creek Associates asked more than 1,300 Web-based mentoring participants to rate the effectiveness of various training and learning opportunities. Respondents overwhelmingly chose hands-on interpersonal methods of training as the most effective, with 88 percent rating on-the-job training and 80 percent rating mentoring/coaching as highly or mostly effective. E-learning ranked lowest, with only 37 percent of respondents rating it as highly or mostly effective.||
||对于意义深远的开发和学习复杂技能，人际的互动是关键性的。调查结果表明：比起简单的获得文件、数据或事实，参与学习的人们感到相关的互动来得更为重要。机构必须针对这样的现实做出调整，以为人们提供进行社会知识关联的途径。||Human interaction is critical to meaningful development and learning complex skills. The survey results show that people involved in learning feel relational interaction is more important than simply having access to documents, data or facts. Organizations must tune in to this reality and offer ways for people to engage in social knowledge relationships.||
||机构如何让人们分享有意义的知识呢？ 他们怎样帮助人们来寻找正确的知识来源呢？他们又是怎样将它们相互联系的呢？他们又怎样鼓励他们分享见识和信息呢？||How do organizations get people to share meaningful knowledge? How do they help people find the right knowledge sources? How do they get them connected with one another? How do they encourage them to share insight and information?||
|| || ||
||对于学习引导者必须重视的的问题(看起来这似乎是老一套)但事实是知识管理的未来就在现在。这个世界在不断变换，并且不可预测，机构没有时间来设计一个自上而下的系统，也没有制定能帮助知识流向最需要它的那些人的一种严密的形式。学习引导者和知识管理的实践都必须使眼下适应并跟上不断变化的需要。||These are the questions learning leaders must address immediately. It may seem trite, but the truth is the future of knowledge management is now. The world is constantly shifting and unpredictable. Organizations do not have time to engineer a system from the top down, nor does such a rigid formation help knowledge flow to the ones who need it most. Learning leaders and the practice of knowledge management must adapt right now to keep up with ever-changing needs.||
||为了达到这一点，知识管理必须将重点放在四个方面：||To accomplish this, knowledge management must focus on four areas:||
||1． 了解谁是知识源；||1. Understanding who the knowledge sources are.||
||2． 探求知识流向哪里和如何流动；||2. Measuring where and how knowledge flows.||
||3． 让知识更加迅速和畅通无阻地流动；||3. Getting knowledge to flow more rapidly and freely.||
||4． 借助于支持性的关联来增强知识。||4. Reinforcing knowledge with supportive relationships.||
||一旦这四个方面相互协调地运转，并且信息自由流通，知识管理就将成为必须能有效强调个体多样化的和变化着的学习需求的流体及可适应的实体。||Once these four areas are working in harmony with one another and information is free-flowing, knowledge management will become the fluid and adaptable entity it needs to be to effectively address individuals’ multiple and shifting learning needs.||

== 谁知道什么? ==
||厘清关键知识资源可能是非常有挑战性的，下岗和并购颠覆了机构内原有的均势和知识平衡。原先曾是知识来源的人可能不再在那里，并且曾经平稳运行的业务现在事情变得杂乱无章。信息和知识流已经被中断，人们挣扎着寻找立足点。||
Identifying key knowledge resources can be challenging. Layoffs and mergers have shifted the balance and knowledge equilibrium within organizations. People who were once knowledge sources may no longer be there, and what was once a smooth operation is now a frantic scramble to get things done. The stream of information and knowledge has been interrupted, and people are floundering to find footing.||
||这些都是实实在在的事，因此，机构需要更深入了解典型的知识经纪人，而不只是肤浅的表层。处于草根地位、但对于其同事却是宝贵的知识资源的人们，并不总是让领导了解他们的技术专长和服务。他们经常做着他们的工作，而得不到来自管理层的赞赏和承认。按他们的想法，他们可能只是在做他们的工作而已。||With these realities, organizations need to look deeper than the superficial level of typical knowledge brokers. People who are valuable knowledge resources to their colleagues at a grassroots level do not always make their expertise and service known to leadership. They often do what they do without accolades or acknowledgement from management. In their minds, they may simply be doing their jobs.||
||这些最底层的知识源为机构的大目标服务，他们帮助向同事的知识和技能传播，在关键时刻传递信息和数据、并提供支持和专门技术给需要的那些人。在三湾（Triple Creek）的调查中，有69%的回答者说通过良师益友传递宝贵的知识是如何使他们为他们公司的成功做出贡献的。||These grassroots knowledge sources serve a great purpose to the organization. They help spread knowledge and skills to colleagues, passing along information and data at critical moments and offering support and know-how to those in need. In Triple Creek’s survey, 69 percent of respondents said transferring valuable knowledge through mentoring is how they contribute to the success of their companies.||
||当要求指出在10个不同方面由于良师益友而得到改进的程度时，评价最高的方面是“扩大了我的知识网络”。当他们没注意到或忽略了这些隐含的资源时，机构遭受损失，因此，精确地确定谁是他们的知识共享明星、并为了更好地重视他们和发挥他们的作用而突显他们很关键。||When asked to indicate the level of improvement across 10 different areas due to mentoring, the top-ranked area was “expanding my network.” Organizations lose out when they overlook or ignore these hidden resources, making it critical that they pinpoint who their knowledge-sharing superstars are and leverage them for greater use and visibility.||
||一个新出现称为“社会网络分析”、有时候又称之为“社会性地图”的做法通过确定人们去找谁获得信息来论述这个问题。他们在搜索信息时沿着一条控制链、还是下到门厅去找他们的同事？||An emerging practice called “social network analysis,” sometimes referred to as “social mapping,” addresses this issue by identifying who people go to for information. Do they follow a chain of command when searching for information, or do they go to their co-worker down the hall?||
||通过分析人们在哪里寻求信息、社会网络分析经常能揭示出隐含的资产或当同事们去寻求知识源时才得以知道的那些人，但他们可能并不在管理层的探测范围之内。这使得机构能够在他们由于具有知识分享主动权而抛头露面时发掘出深藏的知识源和现成的信息源。||By analyzing where people seek information, social network analysis often reveals hidden assets or people who are known as the go-to source by colleagues but who may not be on management’s radar. This allows organizations to tap into deep wells of knowledge and ready sources of information as they move forward with knowledge-sharing initiatives.||
||一旦机构鉴别出谁是他们的知识源，他们就需要确定信息正在流向哪里和如何流动。在某个人周围是否存在信息瓶颈？信息是否落入某个特定班组周围的一个黑洞而丢失？信息流在某些同事之间流动顺利吗？||Once organizations identify who their knowledge sources are, they need to identify where and how information is flowing. Is there an information bottleneck around one person? Does information get lost in a black hole around a particular team? Does the flow of information run smoothly between certain colleagues?||
||对于走向一个更加平民化并更加自由流动的知识共享模式，了解在机构内知识如何传递很关键。如果学识带头人不开发出底层资源并允许人们相互使用，他们将疏远许多部门的劳动力并阻碍创造性和学习。给人们以自由自行组织并在他们需要的准确时刻去搜寻他们所需要的知识资源，将创造出一个更加公平合理的共享知识的实践。||Understanding how knowledge is transferred in the organization is critical to moving toward a more democratic and free-flowing pattern of knowledge sharing. If learning leaders do not tap into grassroots resources and allow people to access one another, they will alienate large sections of the workforce and stymie creativity and learning. Giving people the freedom to self-organize and search out the knowledge resource they need at the exact moment they need it will create a more equitable and streamlined practice for sharing knowledge.||


== 我们如何达成这点? ==
||在今天乱哄哄的24x7（每周7天，每天24小时）世界上，知识必须迅速而自由地从专家知识源那里直接流到需要它的人们手中。没有人有时间四处等待数据。知识是关键性的，而要达到成功，在您确实需要它的时候得到所需的信息则至关紧要。为了机构的繁荣，必须创造平民化而透明的渠道来获取隐藏着（in-house）的知识资源，这将帮助他们的工人们更容易地找到也是他们同事的那个知识源、并和他进行交流。知识管理的真言必须是：*易得，无所不在和平民化的。*||In today’s hectic 24x7 world, knowledge must flow rapidly and freely from expert sources directly to the people who need it. No one has time to wait around for data. Knowledge is critical, and getting the information needed exactly when you need it is vital to achieving success. To thrive, organizations must create democratic and transparent ways to access knowledge resources in-house that will help their workers find and interact more easily with the knowledge source who is also their colleague. The mantra for knowledge management must be: accessible, ubiquitous and democratic.||
||技术的应用协助人们创造了一个又一个、越来越多能够大大便利这种知识共享和学习交流的服务，并主导在所有参与人之间信息和概念的授受。所有分享的信息和所建立起来的概念都保持在公司内，而不是散失到某个外界知识源。这不仅从智力资本的观点看加强了机构，而且也增强了合作者之间的紧密联系、并创造了一个友善忠诚的一个环境。||The use of technologies that help people create one-to-one and one-to-many knowledge-sharing and learning relationships can facilitate this type of knowledge exchange, leading to a give-and-take of information and ideas between all parties involved. By keeping these interactions in-house, all of the information shared and the ideas created are kept within the company, rather than lost to an outside source. This not only strengthens the organization from an intellectual capital standpoint, but it also strengthens the bonds between co-workers and creates an environment of goodwill and camaraderie.||
||这种隐藏着的构成也激励机构去寻找和挖掘未被开发利用的资源、那些不知为什么会通过裂缝给漏掉（slip through the cracks）的人。隐藏着的知识交流要求我们重视打开信息和交流的线路，并搞活知识共享。要把这种做法植入企业内的核心过程中——诸如入职、管理培训和业绩改善——在工作经验的关键节点为员工建立起多样化的学习途径。||The in-house structure also spurs organizations to find and leverage untapped resources, those people who somehow slip through the cracks. In-house knowledge exchange puts an emphasis on opening up the lines of information and communication, and invigorates knowledge sharing. Embedding this practice into core processes within the enterprise — such as on-boarding, management training and performance improvement — creates multiple learning avenues for employees at critical junctures in the employment experience.||
||CDW公司通过其完整的在线开发程序组"Achieve It"~归档之!将这些概念溶入了企业生活中，起到了网基良师益友的重要作用。设计了这个程序组来帮助CDW构建一种内含的知识共享和学习文化，在这种文化中，允许合作者提出他们的发展需求；不问角色、部门或场所进行跨机构的相互联系；及进行非正式的学习。 ||CDW Corp. brought these ideas to life through its holistic online development suite, Achieve It!, featuring Web-based mentoring. The suite was designed to help CDW build an inclusive knowledge-sharing and learning culture in which co-workers are empowered to address their development needs; make cross-organizational connections with one another regardless of role, department or location; and engage in informal learning.||
||在CDW，对支持性的学习关联的欲望飞涨，并且，作为一种知识管理的运载工具，良师益友留下来的好经验很容易加以调整就满足其需要。结果，CDW在程序的实际引用中赢得了2008年ASTD优秀。||The desire for supportive learning relationships at CDW has skyrocketed, and the legacy practice of mentoring was easily adjusted to meet its needs as a vehicle for knowledge management. As a result, CDW won a 2008 ASTD Excellence in Practice Citation for the program.||
||通过借助于支持性的关联加强知识共享。机构允许人们按他们自己的步调来学习、专注他们独特的需求、并以适合他们的方式进行学习。学习必须能加以扩大并具有灵活性，以满足各个个体的学习情况，并帮助他们实现他们的业绩目标。从关于对做出受教育决定的一个学科所需要的一般信息，到进行工作的技术性和相关技能及有效地运用个人的人际关系；到对职业生涯有更深的理解，影响业务决定的外部影响力的机构文化和知识，每个人都有其独特的需求。并且，学习的广度延伸跨越很关阔的可能范围。||By reinforcing knowledge sharing with supportive relationships, organizations allow people to learn at their own paces, focus on their unique needs and learn in styles that suits them. Learning must be able to expand and flex to meet people’s individual learning situations and help them meet their performance goals. From needing general information about a subject to make educated decisions; to technical and relational skills to do their jobs and manage personal interactions productively; to greater understanding about career choices, organizational culture and knowledge of external forces that impact business decisions, each person has unique knowledge needs. And the scope of learning ranges across a broad spectrum of possibilities.||
||20世纪90年代末，John Seely Brown创立了知识生态学的概念来加速创造性的学习。在强调产生具体的工作成果的同时，他提倡在自发和组织之间的平衡，以允许自由地探求选项和观念。||In the late 1990s, John Seely Brown created the image of knowledge ecologies to accelerate creative learning. He advocated a balance between spontaneity and structure that allows for the freedom to explore options and ideas while addressing the need to produce concrete work results.||
||生态学通过提供成长机会得到营养。要想兴旺，机构需要一种能提供多样化学习机会的综合方法。现实是：没有任何一名管理人员，也没有一名良师益友个人、或一个特定的培训班、或某个传递下来的单一经验能满足一个人的所有知识需求。为了在今天的环境下进行学习，工人们需要参加多样性的相互协作学习的自由。为了实际有效，这些学习机会 *应当包含在每天工作的组织安排中* ，在这样的组织安排中，员工有寻求知识源并按他们自己的步调进行学习的自由。||Ecologies are nurtured by providing opportunities for growth. To flourish, organizations need an integrated approach that provides multiple learning opportunities. The reality is that no manager can meet all of the knowledge needs of one person, nor can a single mentor or a particular training class or a singular hands-on experience. To access the learning required in today’s environment, workers need the freedom to engage in multiple collaborative learning experiences. To be effective and impactful, these learning opportunities should be embedded into the structure of everyday work, where employees have the freedom to seek out knowledge sources and learn at their own paces.||
||知识管理的未来寓于越来越多地使用社会网络和人对人的知识交流之中。这一尚未被充分利用却急速增长的策略将帮助人们更加自由的联系、更主动地学习、和在工作中更加有效地应用他们的知识。当机构提供了相互协调的知识共享机会时，创建一个在其中以多样性的方式进行学习的知识生态学将变得更加简单。||The future of knowledge management lies in the growing use of social networks and person-to-person knowledge exchange. This underutilized but burgeoning strategy will help people connect more freely, learn more actively and apply their knowledge more effectively on the job. Creating a knowledge ecology in which learning takes place in multiple ways becomes much simpler when organizations offer integrated knowledge-sharing opportunities.||
||在今后几年中，查出信息的阻断点，寻找作为隐含知识资源的人，并打开同事之间的信息流，是学识型专业人员的迫切问题。为了强调这种关注，必须使人们能够并鼓励他们在为他们不同而独特的学习需求定制的相互协调的学习关联中相互联系，并且给予他们继续的机会。只有到那时，我们才将具有可得的、无所不在的和平民化的知识管理。||Identifying information blockades, finding people who are hidden resources and opening up the flow of information between colleagues are the pressing matters for learning professionals in the coming years. To address these concerns, people must be enabled and encouraged to connect with each other in collaborative learning relationships that are tailored to their various and unique learning needs, and they must be given opportunities to succeed. Only then will we have accessible, ubiquitous and democratic knowledge management.||
